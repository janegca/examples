        <h1>Position Example: absolute</h1>
        <p>
          An element with a property of <code>position: absolute</code> creates
          a positioning context relative to another element on the page i.e. a
          positioned ancestor or, if it has no positioned ancestors, the root
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The element's offset properties will be relative to the position of
          the other element i.e. to the top,left of the enclosing parent or the
          document root.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an absolutely positioned element is moved it is taken out of the
          normal flow, its original space is <strong>not</strong> maintained,
          and it will overlap any element found in its new position.
        </p>

      <div class="boxes">
        <div class="wrap">
          <div class="box"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="box accent">
          <span class="dot"></span>
        </div>

        <div class="wrap">
          <div class="box"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The highlighted box in the above example is moved 25 units from the top
        and 57 units to the left of the page's top, left corner. The space it
        would normally have occupied (between the two blue boxes) has collapsed.
        The red dot it contains is also absolutely positioned, but, as its
        container is a positioned element, it stays confined within in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The highlighted box, and the absolutely positioned red dot within it,
        will move independently of the blue boxes as the page is resized.
