        <p>
          An element with a property of
          <code>position: relative</code> sets up a new positioning context for
          itself and any descendant that has a property of
          <code>position: absolute</code>. The element remains in its original
          position in the normal document flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The offset properties <code>top right bottom left</code> can be used
          to re-position the element <i>relative</i> to its original position.
          If re-positioned, the space it occupied originally is visually
          maintained and the re-positioned element will overlay any elements
          occupying the space in its new position.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="boxes">
        <div class="wrap">
          <div class="box"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="wrap">
          <div class="box accent">
            <span class="dot"></span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="wrap">
          <div class="box" id="last">
            <span class="dot"></span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the example above, the highlighted box is moved 5 units down from the
        top and 7 units to the left of its original position (the box's top left
        corner). The space it originally occupied is retained, as shown by the
        empty frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        The red dot (with <code>postion: absolute</code>), nested and centered
        in the box, moves with it, maintaining its position when the window is
        resized.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the left there is a dark blue dot whose element (in the HTML) is
        nested inside the third box. When it is moved 50 units from the top and
        15 units to the left rather than being moved relative to the box element
        it is nested within, it is moved relative to the viewport as:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          its immediate ancestor (the third box element) is
          <strong>not</strong> a <i>positioned element</i> (it still has default
          <code>position: static</code> )
        </li>
        <li>there are no other positioned element ancestors</li>
        <li>
          no <code>transform perspective</code> or <code>filter</code> property
          (which can establish a new positioning context) has been set on an
          ancestor element
        </li>
      </ol>
      The blue dot will move around the viewport as the page is resized.
    </div>
