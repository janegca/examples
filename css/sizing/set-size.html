    <h1>Setting the Page Size</h1>
    <p>
      Setting the initial page size can be confusing at times. Here, we want it
      to equal the the viewport width and height but also be able to scroll
      vertically (not horizontally) when the content becomes longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, lets set the page to the full viewport height. We can do this by
      setting <code>min-height: 100%</code> on the <code>html</code> element; it
      inherits from the viewport so the page will have a height equal to
      <code>100vh</code> or the full height of the browser's visible display
      area. We'll also add the margins back to the header and paragraphs, and
      give the paragraphs some padding to make things easier to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that if you try this directly on the <code>body</code> element the
      page will not expand to fill the window height. Percentage values are
      relative to the parent container, if no specific height is set on the
      <code>html</code>
      element the body will be sized at 100% of zero, and so just default back
      to its content's height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>height</code> property is not inherited so even though the
      <code>html</code> element is implicitly equal to the viewport to the
      elements descendents the width and height values are zero unless they have
      been explicitly set. This is true for any element, if no explicit width
      and height are set on the parent element taking a percentage value will be
      the same as setting width and height to zero regardless of how large the
      parent element actually is.
    </p>
    <h2>A More Direct Approach</h2>
    <p>
      In practice, it is much simpler, and more common, to set
      <code>min-height: 100vh</code> in the <code>body</code> element and, due
      to the peculiar relationship between the <code>html</code> and
      <code>body</code> elements, the <code>html</code> height will grow along
      with the body's height. What the earlier settings demonstrate is why it is
      better to prefer <code>100vh</code> over <code>100%</code> when setting
      the page height. This is not true for setting the page width.
    </p>
    <h2>Setting the Page Width</h2>
    <p>
      We should always prefer to leave the width unset or use the default
      <code>auto</code> if we need to explicitly set it. Setting the width to
      <code>100%</code> or <code>100vw</code> will trigger the horizontal scroll
      bar the minute the vertical scrollbar is triggered, something we do not
      want, especially on mobile devices. Browsers calculate the full width to
      be the visible width <em>less</em> the width of the vertical scrollbar. As
      that means it can no longer have <code>100%</code> or
      <code>100vw</code> of the screen, it flags an overflow condition and the
      horizontal scrollbar is turned on. The <code>auto</code> default takes the
      vertical scrollbar into account and does not trigger an overflow
      condition.
    </p>
    <h2>Setting the Size of Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to have an empty wrapper for later use, setting a
      <code>min-height</code> with a percentage will not work if the body only
      has a <code>min-height</code> itself. You need to set an explicit height
      or some padding i.e. <code>padding-top: 25%</code> this will use 25% of
      the parent's (in this case, the body's) <em>width</em> even though no
      explicit width has been set on the body (see the empty
      <code>div</code> below).
