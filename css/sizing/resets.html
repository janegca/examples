    <h1>Element Sizing After Standard Resets are Applied</h1>
    <p>
      Here, the browser margins and padding have been removed and the
      <code>box-sizing</code> for all elements has been changed from the default
      <code>content-box</code> to <code>border-box</code>. These are standard
      resets that many people apply before creating any other CSS rulesets.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can no longer see any of the body's background-color as the header and
      paragraph margins have been removed.
